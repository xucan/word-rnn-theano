i told them what you said about the script .

<person> said she ran away about six months ago .

what are you doing over at the lanes that ' s so dangerous , <person> ?

dr . <person> must have found it unnecessary in later versions .
<person> ? i was trying something different . i was crashing differently . ambivalently .
you mean , you think i ' m cracking ?

i ' m sorry . <person> , i ' m not real comfortable being here , but .

hello , <person> . how extraordinary that you came .

so , how ' d it go last night ?

<person> somebody please tell me where we ' re going ?
ah , see , that ' s the thing . somehow they don ' t come back until you really don ' t care anymore .
no . not mean . just . very angry .

then we ' re in the same place that we ' re in right now !
that was wacky ! i almost lost you in the traffic .
however , we can also pray for other things .
you are . you ' re losing your mind . what about <person> ?
then i guess you ' re stuck . life sentence . no parole .
what if i was <person> ? you ' d be dead right now . what are you doing giving interviews on tv ?
it wasn ' t my fault ! they just showed up . it ' s helping the convent .
it ' s no you , it ' s .

i checked the place out . there weren ' t no dicks in there .

how could you see his face in the dark ?
if you think i ' m enjoying this , you ' re wrong .
what ' s their offer ? what can they possibly threaten me with after so colossally fucking me ? spit it out , you spineless turd .

well , then we got good news for th .
hey , it ' s my treat . you agreed .
still . <person> like we could figure out . something .
i don ' t know , but whatever it is , it ' s only six hours away .

but what if <person> is what there was before the big bang ?
as i said , it is beyond our comprehension .
so <person> , what are you doing ? are you still cleaning houses ?
the ideals are still alive , count , even if the institution is failing .
ja , mada chod . he ' s not looking for you . ja !
<person> off the winter blues . come celebrate the spring .

you burn him , you lose any chance you ever had .
that ' s good . now that louse is outa <person> ' s hair for good .

i feel alone sometimes . i feel exhausted . can i say something awful ?
hey ! <person> . hi . i had bad reception . are you at the party ?
not the little shit who lives here . the other son . the secret son . the negro son you deny .
the black son you make live in central park while you ' re gallivanting around rome . the doorman spits at flan again .

really , what do you look for in women you date ?

no ! try not . do . or do not . there is no try .
i can ' t . it ' s too big .

<person> . it ' s pretty far , but i think we can make it .
i don ' t think so . it ' s been tough , huh ?
well , he fired the nurse after an hour , now says he doesn ' t need one .

i know it ' s fast . but i also know i love you .
i don ' t think you do love me .
what happens if it doesn ' t match anything ?

oh . <person> . <person> found myself wondering what was inside that truck .
you will never age for me , nor fade , nor die .

we found him , mrs . <person> . tangled in his net .

are you afraid <person> is mixed up in this fraud ?
that <person> kid , he ' s gonna break your old passing records this friday .
they ' re in the sub , sir . waiting .
no , actually , i ' m an assistant .

if this true . this could be da year .
who ? i know no one by that name .
what about the gravimetric distortions ? they ' ll tear us apart .
your authority ends now . it ' s all over .
<person> ' t totally decided . he can live or he can die .
you don ' t . look afraid . you look fearless .
boy the view from up here . you know the territory ?

where have you been , you almost blew it .
ten minutes . maybe . when i returned , that was on the screen .

we id ' d the remains in the morgue . the real id .

well . it ' s the thought that counts .

i don ' t know why you ' re here . why are you here , <person> ?

well , you could , when you where in the boy scouts .
yes , but i am not in the boy scouts anymore . you heard the private sector ?
i should ' ve pegged you guys for bowling dicks from day one .
you should probably hit the road . go home . this place could get hazardous for your health .
oh my god . i ' m so sorry , <person> .

two weeks , three at the most , <person> ! for pity ' s sake .

i liked it when you caught me fucking him . <person> !

one more thing . <person> mentioned he was recruited by someone named <person> . any idea who that might be ?

no , <person> . i think it ' s working perfectly .

well , i finished my circle . i don ' t pick up any life readings .
oh , yes . they were alike in many ways . <person> individual thinkers . idealists .
interesting . i ' m still not sure i understand .
well , at least you ' re out there seeing people again . that ' s terrific .
the users . you really think they ' re still there ?

<person> ' t get clever or i ' ll get the electricity out again .
they didn ' t ask me that question . i don ' t know why . ask them .
<person> , you don ' t seem that interested in money .

the choir , <person> . go for the gold .

<person> ? . oh . he ' s not here . he ' s gone .

what the fuck you care , new fish ? <person> ' t matter what his fuckin ' name was . he ' s dead .

great catch , kid . the boy runs off .

<person> . <person> intelligence . but ' til i hear otherwise this is still my show .

yeh , but i don ' t know where he is .

it ' s even stronger in him than it is in you .
that ' s all right . forget it . i guess i ' m pretty jumpy .

i haven ' t seen her since she switched schools .
he ' s on the island , he ' ll be back on .

me too . maybe it ' s our day .

you bet , doctor . we ' re on our way !

do you know why the governor is the governor ?

<person> down , <person> . how about goin ' down below an ' havin ' one on me ?

never mind what i got , i am looking for <person> ?
no . it ' s just . i don ' t feel like there ' s enough there .
i do not look at the downed man , <person> .
i was wondering why you haven ' t been sleeping over . jules , i don ' t think you should start bopping your boss .
an old man who doesn ' t wear underwear .

so you knew this when you wrote your report ?
as can be expected . how ' s <person> ?
. when i dropped the guy . the girl ' s <person> sign . she was there . at the cape . the girl was there .
usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities , but this one ' s pretty damn good . this is the new one , right , <person> ?
hey , i broke up with them for good reasons .
love . i ' m such an idiot for not knowing about this book . it ' s famous , it turns out .

i couldn ' t afford it . <person> is looking at her , looking through her .
the one that was weighted down . where is she . ? fred something .
<person> , from belvedere , ohio . the first girl taken , but the third body found . why ?
' cause she didn ' t drift . he weighted her down .

he can ' t know we ' re talking .
yeah . well . why you approach me ? i ' m not .

<person> , now the cards are on the table .

<person> , please , i can ' t bear it if you go .
she must get lonely , with you gone all the time . does she ?
it ' s accelerating . you have no more time for games .
but we agreed your job is running the baby machine .
do you have any questions , mr . <person> ?
nope . no . i ' m not sure . i think he ended up marrying <person> .
you boys must have had an extraordinary classroom experience .
oh , that ' s . you can pour .

least i ' m no airport rat . i work the whole town .
i don ' t like people looking at me like that .

maybe that ' s why it ' s good . it ' s true , it ' s moving . now why don ' t you use that character .

inflation , tuition , college . children are damned expensive . i know .
i know . i wish you ' d shoot me .
i don ' t know . i guess kids were hitting each other or something .
i want your guarantee they ' ll be turned loose when she opens the front door .
i get my hostage first . no one ' s turned loose until i say so .
i know that , <person> . i , we all know .
then what about practicing ? perhaps i ' d better forget <person> ?

we ' ll have them in no time , sir . long before the interrupt interface .
<person> ? that ' s funny . i haven ' t noticed that .
where were you all day ? you look terrible .
you are the first woman i ' m going out with .

oh , you can ' t let me do that . what precisely is your involvement with these people .
i don ' t know why i ' m so scared , <person> . is it something awful ?
i don ' t think that ' s the way it works , cole .
my father wants me in new york . he builds boats . i ' d rather sail them . i travel under my mother ' s name .
with all respect for your expertise , sir . we ' re on track here .

<person> . <person> . now , i understand the divorce .

your performance in the mound is not as good as last year . what is the problem ?
your performance in the mound is not good as last year . what is problem ?
i don ' t know . maybe my mechanic .

i think agents are safer when they have some company . i can send along <person> if you ' d rather .
no . did you ever steal anything ? you ever hit someone ?

when i twisted hair like this it means i ' m intimidated by you .
then why don ' t you stay with them again ?

i shooed him away ! the police said it was an accident but .

no , no , look , there was this radioactive experiment . i was poisoned !

i told you . he let me go . i ' m on my way home .
sure thing , just don ' t take the train .
they ' ll do their job well , i ' ll guarantee that .
well , if we get stopped will you at least let me say that i commandeered the vehicle , but i let you drive ?
i might if i saw the case file . you could get that for me .
neither could i . i think it ' s <person> .

i think we ' d better shut off all access till we can find that file .

<person> . see if you can sober him up .
the brooklyn bridge . <person> between both our places .
you ' d cry . cause you miss grandma so much .
that ' s right . so why do you take it , sweetheart ?

how could she turn on me like that ? i thought she liked me .
you are the first woman i ' m going out with .

you should probably hit the road . go home . this place could get hazardous for your health .
you call it stooling , we call it cooperating . <person> looks under theo ' s car .

<person> . so i ' m reading the trial .
you know who . how much is she complicit in all this ?
they are or they aren ' t . which is it ?

come clean , <person> . at night you weep for those lost closeups , those gala openings .

<person> ' . i told ya everything there is .
then why ' d ya move outa your room ?

i thought real men don ' t like quiche .
then maybe you can tell me if he ' s as solid as you say , why does he rap me every chance he gets ?

i hope you ' ll forgive the darkness . we ' re not comfortable in the light .
all i ' m saying is , someone should keep an eye on him .

wanting it doesn ' t make you the best one for the job .
well don ' t move it now , otherwise people will see the damage . what did you do that for ? ^
you could climb off my back , that ' d help .

well , you just came from the liquor store , give us your liquor .
i didn ' t get any . they ' re not letting anyone in . they ' re arresting someone or something .

it ' s you up on that stage , not him . you don ' t need him .

i don ' t know why i ' m so scared , <person> . is it something awful ?
you still like me , don ' t you ? we ' re still buddies ?
<person> , i know you ' re tired , but can you drop me at the retinal fetish ?

now we ' re talking . how about you <person> ?

<person> ? how come it ' s white ? <person> ' t noir mean dark ?
<person> . they don ' t call me the wizard for nothing .
<person> , if i may comment , i do not believe the .
<person> , please ! i don ' t want any more guards !

yes , it fucking does <person> . if it so much as farts it ' s out .

he ' s saying , what are you saying , <person> ?
<person> ! <person> ' t it great , <person> ? i found it in naples . i bargained for about two weeks .
it ' s <person> , you should be doing it .
you ' re crazy . you ' ve gone crazy .
what do you care anyway ? you don ' t even like <person> .
you crazy fool ! you think you can get away with that ?

. it ' s just that you ' ve been there .
i thought you might want your drawings back . just until you get your view .
nobody sent me . i came on my own .

dr . <person> must have found it unnecessary in later versions .
well , you should be careful boys . that ' s how accidents happen .
he ' s pitching now . you should see him , <person> , got an arm like his brother .
anything ' s possible . <person> , please listen .
then you do feel something ! there ' s an extraordinary connection between us . you can ' t deny that .

he ' s saying , what are you saying , <person> ?

no , she didn ' t <person> . but i think you should do the scene .
he stalks her . he rapes her . then he does her .
<person> at you , you ' re sleeping . <person> how vulnerable you are . i mean , i could do anything at that point .

i thought i might come back . in the new year . under my own steam .
then do that , starling . do just exactly that .

how ' d you get the tape ? why didn ' t the cops put it in evidence ?

<person> , i ' ll accept that slight hostility because i ' m enjoying your company so much .

we don ' t show her breasts , we just show your reaction .
i ' m so comfortable with that , <person> , i can ' t tell you .
but you ' re going skiing with us yankees , aren ' t you ?
i don ' t know . i suppose until they find out who did it .

why won ' t it come for you <person> ? the way you talk about it ' s so engaging .
yeah but there ' s an academic style , you know ?
who are you writing for ? who ' s your ideal reader ?

i don ' t see how that concerns you , <person> .

<person> , the temperature ' s dropping too rapidly .
i made that paella you liked . it ' s on the stove .
so every time you think about showing that jury strength . or honor or composure . or dignity .
i think i can probably do that on my own .

i wasn ' t told . i just knew it .
you don ' t feel any emotion about it one way or the other ?
i was lonely . perhaps i ' m not aging as well as you did .
i ' m sorry . am i interrupting anything ?
no . no . i like women . i only like women .
here ' s the most important place in the house . grab this stuff whenever you want .

i pay you fucking rent don ' t i ?

no , you ' re not , nobody thinks i ' m anything special . only my mother . my father hates me .
believe me , i don ' t have the answer for anything .
you shouldn ' t laugh at people . it makes them feel bad .
all right . i ' d better start familiarizing myself with the flight controls .
<person> ' s at the access hatch , captain .
sure . i ' ll fix it right away .

why ' d you fight with her , <person> . ?
let me see if i get where you ' re headed here . . .

i could call him . maybe he ' d join us .
they knew it was aboard the observatory . if the enterprise hadn ' t intervened , they would have found it .

it ' s never the question that ' s indiscreet , only the answer .

you ' ve taken your first step toward perfection . how does it feel ?
then how do i know all those things about you if we ' ve never spoken before ?
i don ' t know . i don ' t understand <person> , <person> , so your guess is as good as mine .

five years ago they told me you were dead .
where do you think they are , they ' re in bed ?
